# Corvid-19 Status Dashboard Server

This project was generated with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v12.15.0/) version v12.15.0.

## Motivation

This prototype project was designed as a part of the "LMS Integration - Technical interview phase 1".

## Development server

Run `npm run dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Testing

Use an API development tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to test the API endpoints. All API requests require a pre-shared auth token and results in status codes.
